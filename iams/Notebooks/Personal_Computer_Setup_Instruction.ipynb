    "## 0. git - Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system for tracking changes in code development, especially when teams of developers are working together. Git stores code (or any file type) change history and keeps track of all changes you make along the way.  All your code changes will be held in a \"repository\" (or repo) There are online services which you can use to host online repositories (Gitlab and GitHub are the most popular ones).  This way it is very easy to collaborate with others on your projects.  Anyone who is included as a team member for a particular repository of code/files/etc. can make a 'clone' of that code on their own machine. Then you can make changes to the code, commit them to your local repo (stored on your PC) and then 'push' those changes back up to the main online repository (stored via online service, GitLab for example). Your teammate, who is also working on the same code base can then 'pull' the changes that you made, and incorporate them into the work that she is doing.\n",
    "The Uvic Faculty of Engineering provides an [engineering gitlab](git.engr.uvic.ca) service integrated with single sign-on, so you can log in to your account with your uvic credentials.  The following steps will guide you through downloading the course material from Dr. McPherson's personal GitLab, creating your own repo local repo and pushing it to your engineering GitLab instance.\n",

    "            \n",
    "#### 0.5 Generate SSH Keys and link them to your GitLab account:\n",
    "SSH keys provide a convenient and secure way of establishing a connection between your local machine and the server (git.engr.uvic) where your files are hosted.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: You can use existing SSH keys if you have already generated some in the past.  For ease of use with git, SSH keys should be stored in the .ssh/ folder relative to your user home directory (e.g. C:\\Users\\userid\\.ssh\\ on Windows machines)\n",
    "1. Start your git terminal - on Windows, it is called \"Git Bash\"\n",
    "1. Use the following command in the git terminal to generate ssh keys:<br>\n",
    "`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C \"netlinkID@uvic.ca\"`<br>\n",
    "Replace netlinkID with your own netlinkID\n",
    "1. You will be prompted for the save location, keep the default by pressing enter\n",
    "1. You will be prompted to give your keyfile a passphrase, optional, but recommended. Press enter for no password\n",
    "1. At this point you should be able to see you new ssh keys on your local PC through file explorer, navigate to them, and open the **public** (has .pub extention) key in your text editor of choice and copy the content\n",
    "1. Go to your [gitlab profile](git.engr.uvic.ca/profile) settings and click \"SSH Keys\" on the left sidebar\n",
    "1. Paste the contents of your **public** key into the \"Key\" window, give your key a title (e.g. laptop key), then click \"Add key\"\n",
    "Now your gitlab account has registered your public key. You should get an email to your uvic account confirming a key has been added.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.6 Download the course code:\n",
    "[Option 1] \n",
    "1. Go to [IAMS_for_Energy_Systems_Transitions](https://gitlab.com/McPherson/iams_for_energy_systems_transitions) and click the download button (directly to the left of the \"Clone\" button) and select \".zip\" to download a .zip version of the repository \n",

    "\n",
    "[For options 1 and 2]\n",
    "2. Find the downloaded .zip file on your PC and extract the contents to a location on your PC where you will keep your course material\n",
    "3. (optional) You can rename the repository at this point if you would like.  It's recommended to have it the same as your project title as it's easier to stay organized with many repositories.\n",
    "Now you have the course code on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.7 Creating local and remote repositories of the course code\n",
    "Now we need to get our newly downloaded code over to our GitLab repository\n",
    "1. Start your git terminal - on Windows, it is called \"Git Bash\"\n",
    "1. Set up your global git variables.  Type the following command into the terminal (Replacing your info as necessary):<br>\n",
    "`git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"`<br>\n",
    "`git config --global user.email \"netlinkID@uvic.ca\"`<br>\n",
    "If you see no output then the command ran successfully. You can that it was set properly with\"<br>\n",
    "`git config --get user.name`<br>\n",
    "1. On your git terminal, change the directory (with the `cd` command) to the course code you downloaded and extracted\n",
    "1. Initialize a git repository for the files<br>\n",
    "`git init`<br>\n",
    "1. Tell git where the remote repository (GitLab) is located<br>\n",
    "`git remote add origin git@git.engr.uvic.ca:<group _slug>/<project_slug>.git`<br>\n",
    "Note: the project-slug is the project name all lower case and \"-\" replaced for a \" \" (space)\n",
    "1. Add all the contents of your current folder (which should be your course code folder) to git<br>\n",
    "`git add .`<br>\n",
    "If you get some warning `warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF`, you can ignore those.\n",
    "1. Commits your added files<br>\n",
    "`git commit -m \"First commit\"`<br>\n",
    "1. Push your commit to the gitlab<br>\n",
    "`git push -u origin master`<br>\n",
    "If nothing went wrong you should have just created your first commit to the remote repository!  You can verify your push was successful by checking out your project page on the GitLab web app (git.engr.uvic.ca).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.8 Make your first pull (to get an updated version after a teammate has made a change)\n",
    "1. Go to the master branch to pull the latest changes from there<br>\n",
    "`git checkout master`<br>\n",
    "2. Download the latest changes in the project<br>\n",
    "`git pull REMOTE NAME-OF-BRANCH -u`<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning more about git/GitLab, Paul led a great lunch and learn to introduce git. See his video here:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 0.9 Project management\n",
    "In addition to version control, I encourage you to play around with the many project management features in GitLab. For example, the issues board allows you to keep track of your workflow and to-do list. First, you can create a bunch of issues or things that need to get done. You can then create labels, and tag issues with the relevant labels (such as To-do, or Done!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick definition of GitLab terms:\n",
    "- Start with Issues: tasks that need to get done - use action verbs and be specific (e.g. collect BC's hydropower data)\n",
    "- Add Labels: Descriptions of the issues (e.g. to-do, doing, done) \n",
    "- Lists are then created from labels.  Lists contain issues that have a label with the same name as the list. Issues with that label appear in that list (e.g. stages in the workflow such as data collection, model development, scenario matrix, model results, analysis, and communication).\n",

    "## 2. Configure Python Environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Create a Virtual Environment using Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "If you would prefer to use venv instead of anaconda or simply not use virtual environments feel free to do so at your own discretion. The rest of this section will be about using anaconda virtual environments and it is what we recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now that anaconda is installed on your machine, there should be a program you can run called anaconda prompt. Run it and a terminal should appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the command “cd” to navigate to the folder containing the code for this course and locate the file: environment.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once in this folder create a new environment by executing the command:\n",
    "```conda env create -f environment.yml```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now you should have a new environment called iams. To activate this environment type:\n",
    "```conda activate iams```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. notice that the environment is now activated by seeing the name of the environment at the beginning of each line in the terminal like so: \n",
